# PitchPerfect
### Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree

 First core curriculum project in UDACITY's iOS Developer Nanodegree Program. This app records your voice and will play it back with with six different sound modulations: Chipmunk, Vader, Slow, Fast with Reverb and Echo effect. 

**Multiple Views**
  There are 2 view controller scenes: A RecordingSounds scene, and a PlaySounds scene. 
  The recording scene consists of a record button (mic) and a stop button.
  The playback scene displays the icons for each sound for which you are able to playback your recording. 
  
**IBActions and Outlets**
  This app showcases the implementation of IBAction and Outlets through the use of buttons with functionality.
  
**Sound recording and playback**
  Using a device to record your voice, save it to a "holding cell," and call it through each playback method when the corresponding button is pressed. 
  
**Auto Layout and Buttons**
  Storyboard is used to set the views and the buttons. StackViews are implemented for an aesthetic look to each view controller scene.
